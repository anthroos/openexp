Every Claude Code session starts from zero. OpenExp changes that.

It gives Claude Code **persistent memory that learns**. Not just storage — actual reinforcement learning. Memories that lead to productive sessions (commits, PRs, passing tests) get higher Q-values and surface first next time. Bad memories sink.

The same idea behind AlphaGo, applied to your coding assistant's context window.

## The Problem

Claude Code forgets everything between sessions. You re-explain your project structure, your preferences, your past decisions — every single time.

Existing memory tools just store and retrieve. They treat a two-month-old note about a deleted feature the same as yesterday's critical architecture decision.

## The Solution

OpenExp adds a **closed-loop learning system**:

```
Session starts → recall memories (ranked by Q-value)
    ↓
Claude works → observations captured automatically
    ↓
Session ends → productive? (commits, PRs, tests)
    ↓
    YES → reward recalled memories (Q-values go up)
    NO  → penalize them (Q-values go down)
    ↓
Next session → better memories surface first
```

### Outcome-Based Rewards

Beyond session-level heuristics, OpenExp supports **outcome-based rewards** from real business events. When a CRM deal moves from "negotiation" to "won", the memories tagged with that client get rewarded — even if the deal took weeks to close.

```
add_memory(content="Acme prefers Google stack", client_id="comp-acme")
    ↓
... weeks of work ...
    ↓
CRM: Acme deal moves negotiation → won
    ↓
resolve_outcomes → finds memories tagged comp-acme → reward +0.8
```

This creates a much stronger learning signal than "did this session have git commits?"

After a few sessions, OpenExp learns what context actually helps you get work done.

## Why OpenExp?

| Feature | OpenExp | Mem0 | Zep/Graphiti | LangMem |
|---------|---------|------|-------------|---------|
| **Q-learning on memories** | Yes — memories earn/lose rank from session outcomes | No | No | No |
| **Closed-loop rewards** | Session productivity → Q-value updates automatically | No | No | No |
| **Outcome-based rewards** | Real business events (CRM, deployments) → targeted rewards | No | No | No |
| **Claude Code native** | Zero-config hooks, works out of the box | Requires integration | Requires integration | Requires integration |
| **Local-first** | Qdrant + FastEmbed, no cloud, no API key for core | Cloud API | Cloud or self-hosted | Cloud API |
| **Hybrid retrieval** | BM25 + vector + recency + importance + Q-value (5 signals) | Vector only | Graph + vector | Vector only |
| **Privacy** | All data stays on your machine | Data sent to cloud | Depends on setup | Data sent to cloud |

**The key difference:** other memory tools store and retrieve. OpenExp **learns which memories actually help you get work done** — and surfaces those first next time.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthroos/openexp.git
cd openexp
./setup.sh
```

That's it. Open Claude Code in any project — it now has memory.

> [!TIP]
> No API key needed for core functionality. Embeddings run locally via FastEmbed. An Anthropic API key is optional — it enables auto-enrichment (type classification, tags, validity windows) but everything works great without it.

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, Docker, jq

## What You'll See

When you open Claude Code after a few sessions:

```
# OpenExp Memory (Q-value ranked)
Query: my-project | Monday 2026-03-22

## Relevant Context
[sim=0.82 q=0.73] Fixed auth bug by adding token refresh logic in api/auth.py
[sim=0.76 q=0.65] Project uses FastAPI + PostgreSQL, deployed on Railway
[sim=0.71 q=0.58] User prefers pytest with fixtures, not unittest
```

`q=0.73` means this memory consistently leads to productive sessions. `q=0.31` means it's been recalled but didn't help — it'll rank lower next time.

## How It Works

Three hooks integrate with Claude Code automatically:

| Hook | When | What |
|------|------|------|
| **SessionStart** | Session opens | Searches Qdrant for relevant memories, injects top results as context |
| **UserPromptSubmit** | Every message | Lightweight recall — adds relevant memories to each prompt |
| **PostToolUse** | After Write/Edit/Bash | Captures what Claude does as observations (JSONL) |
| **SessionEnd** | Session closes | Generates summary, triggers ingest + reward (async) |

The MCP server provides 8 tools for explicit memory operations (search, add, predict, reflect).

```

### Q-Learning Details

Every memory has a Q-value (starts at 0.5). Three layers capture different aspects:

| Layer | Weight | Measures |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **action** | 50% | Did recalling this help get work done? |
| **hypothesis** | 20% | Was the information accurate? |
| **fit** | 30% | Was it relevant to the context? |

Update rule:

```
Q_new = (1 - α) × Q_old + α × reward

α = 0.25 (learning rate)
reward ∈ [-0.5, 0.5] (session productivity signal)
```

Retrieval scoring combines five signals:

```
score = 0.30 × vector_similarity    # semantic match
      + 0.10 × bm25_score           # keyword match
      + 0.15 × recency              # exponential decay (90-day half-life)
      + 0.15 × importance           # type-weighted metadata
      + 0.30 × q_value              # learned quality
```

With 10% epsilon-greedy exploration — occasionally surfaces low-Q memories to give them another chance.

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_memory` | Hybrid search: BM25 + vector + Q-value reranking |
| `add_memory` | Store memory with auto-enrichment (type, tags, validity). Supports `client_id` for entity tagging |
| `log_prediction` | Track a prediction for later outcome resolution |
| `log_outcome` | Resolve prediction with reward → updates Q-values |
| `get_agent_context` | Full context: memories + pending predictions |

| `reflect` | Review recent memories for patterns |
| `memory_stats` | Q-cache size, prediction accuracy stats |
| `reload_q_cache` | Hot-reload Q-values from disk |

## CLI

```bash
# Search memories
openexp search -q "authentication flow" -n 5

# Ingest observations into Qdrant
openexp ingest

# Preview what would be ingested (dry run)
openexp ingest --dry-run

# Run outcome resolvers (CRM stage changes → rewards)
openexp resolve

# Show Q-cache statistics
openexp stats
```

## Configuration

All settings via environment variables (`.env`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `QDRANT_HOST` | `localhost` | Qdrant server host |
| `QDRANT_PORT` | `6333` | Qdrant server port |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | *(none)* | Optional: Qdrant auth (also passed to Docker) |
| `OPENEXP_COLLECTION` | `openexp_memories` | Qdrant collection name |
| `OPENEXP_DATA_DIR` | `~/.openexp/data` | Q-cache, predictions, retrieval logs |
| `OPENEXP_OBSERVATIONS_DIR` | `~/.openexp/observations` | Where hooks write observations |
| `OPENEXP_SESSIONS_DIR` | `~/.openexp/sessions` | Session summary files |
| `OPENEXP_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` | Embedding model (local, free) |
| `OPENEXP_EMBEDDING_DIM` | `384` | Embedding dimensions |
| `OPENEXP_INGEST_BATCH_SIZE` | `50` | Batch size for ingestion |
| `OPENEXP_OUTCOME_RESOLVERS` | *(none)* | Outcome resolvers (format: `module:Class`) |
| `OPENEXP_CRM_DIR` | *(none)* | CRM directory for CRMCSVResolver |

### Memory Lifecycle

Memories move through 8 states to prevent stale context:

```
active ──→ confirmed ──→ outdated ──→ archived ──→ deleted
  │            │                          ↑
  ├──→ contradicted ──────────────────────┘
  ├──→ merged
  └──→ superseded
```

Only `active` and `confirmed` memories are returned in searches. Status weights affect scoring: `confirmed=1.2×`, `active=1.0×`, `outdated=0.5×`, `archived=0.3×`.

### Data Flow

```
PostToolUse hook                                  SessionStart hook
      │                                                 ↑

      ↓ (async)                                         │

      │                            ↑

```

## Technical Details

| Component | Choice | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Embeddings** | FastEmbed (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) | Local, free, no API key, 384 dimensions |
| **Vector DB** | Qdrant | Fast ANN search, payload filtering, Docker-ready |
| **Q-Cache** | In-memory LRU (100K entries) | Fast lookup, delta-based persistence for concurrent sessions |
| **Transport** | MCP STDIO (JSON-RPC 2.0) | Native Claude Code integration |
| **Hooks** | Bash scripts | Minimal dependencies, shell-level integration |

## Troubleshooting

**Docker / Qdrant won't start:**
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker info

# Check Qdrant container
docker ps -a | grep openexp-qdrant
docker logs openexp-qdrant
```

**Hooks not firing:**
```bash
# Verify hooks are registered
cat ~/.claude/settings.local.json | jq '.hooks'

# Re-run setup to fix registration
./setup.sh
```

**No memories appearing:**
Memories need to be ingested first. After a few Claude Code sessions:
```bash
openexp ingest --dry-run   # preview what will be ingested
openexp ingest             # ingest into Qdrant
openexp stats              # check Q-cache state
```

- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) — system design and data flow
- [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) — all environment variables and options

## Contributing

This project is in early stages. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup and workflow.

Key areas where help is welcome:

- **Reward signals** — beyond commits/PRs, what indicates a productive session?
- **Compaction** — merging duplicate or outdated memories automatically
- **Multi-project learning** — sharing relevant context across projects
- **Benchmarks** — measuring retrieval quality improvement over time
- **More lifecycle transitions** — automated contradiction detection

## Research

OpenExp implements value-driven memory retrieval inspired by [MemRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09560), adapted for episodic memory in AI coding assistants.

Core insight: treating memory retrieval as a reinforcement learning problem — where the reward signal comes from real session outcomes — produces better context selection than similarity-only search.
