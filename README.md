---

You wrote a skill: "how to work with CRM." Your agent follows it perfectly. But it doesn't know that approach A closed deals and approach B didn't. Tomorrow it'll do the same thing as yesterday — even if yesterday didn't work.

**Skills say *how*. OpenExp teaches *what works*.**

Every outcome — commit, closed deal, resolved ticket — feeds back as a reward signal. Memories that led to results get higher Q-values and surface first next time. Noise sinks.

### Example: sales agent

Your agent sent 200 emails this month. Which formulations got replies? Which approaches closed deals? Skills don't know — there's no feedback loop.

```yaml
# .openexp.yaml in your sales project
experience: sales
```

```
1. Define your pipeline:  lead → contacted → qualified → proposal → won
2. Work normally — Claude remembers client preferences, deal context, pricing
3. Deal closes → all memories tagged with that client get rewarded
4. Next similar deal → the insights that led to the close surface first
```

After a month, your agent "knows" not just how to write emails — but which emails lead to results.

## The Problem

Skills and CLAUDE.md solve the "agent doesn't remember" problem. But they're **static instructions** — written once, never learning from outcomes. Your agent follows the playbook perfectly, but doesn't know which plays actually work.

Existing memory tools (Mem0, Zep, LangMem) add storage — but every memory is equally important. A two-month-old note about a deleted feature has the same weight as yesterday's critical architecture decision.

**The missing piece:** there's no learning. No feedback loop from outcomes to retrieval quality.

## The Solution

OpenExp adds a **closed-loop learning system** with outcome-based rewards:

```
Session starts → recall memories (ranked by Q-value)
    ↓
Agent works → observations + decisions captured automatically
    ↓
Outcomes happen → deal closes, prediction verified, retrospective runs
    ↓
    WIN  → memories that contributed get rewarded (Q-values go up)
    LOSS → memories that misled get penalized (Q-values go down)
    ↓
Next session → better memories surface first
```

### Five Reward Paths

OpenExp doesn't rely on heuristics. It learns from **real outcomes** through five distinct reward paths:

| Path | Trigger | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Prediction** | `log_outcome` resolves a prediction | "Predicted client would accept proposal" → confirmed → +0.8 |
| **Business** | CRM stage transition detected | Deal moved negotiation → won → +0.8 to tagged memories |
| **Calibration** | Manual Q-value override | Expert judgment: "this insight was critical" → set q=0.9 |
| **Retrospective** | Daily LLM analysis (Opus 4.6) | Cross-session patterns: promote undervalued, demote noise |
| **Decision extraction** | Session end (async) | Opus 4.6 reads transcript, extracts strategic decisions |

```
add_memory(content="Acme prefers Google stack", client_id="comp-acme")
    ↓
... weeks of work ...
    ↓
CRM: Acme deal moves negotiation → won
    ↓
resolve_outcomes → finds memories tagged comp-acme → reward +0.8
```

After a few sessions, OpenExp learns what context actually helps you get work done.

## Experience Library

Memories capture individual moments. The Experience Library captures **entire journeys** — from first contact to final outcome — and distills them into reusable lessons.

```
Raw conversations (26K messages)
    ↓ chunk into ~200K token batches
18 chunks
    ↓ Opus extracts topics per chunk
170 topics
    ↓ group across chunks by work thread
36 threads (e.g., "SQUAD HR AI Bot Deal", "МПУВ Document Automation")
    ↓ Opus labels each thread
269 experience labels (context → actions → outcome → lesson)
    ↓ stored in Qdrant as type="experience"
Searchable via search_memory
```

Each experience label is a structured training triplet:

```json
{
  "context": {
    "situation": "Client needs automated report generation from 40-page template",
    "constraints": ["Non-technical operators", "14 communities"],
    "stakeholders": ["Igor Bespalov (client)", "Ivan (builder)"]
  },
  "actions": [
    {"what": "Built 7-stage pipeline with --auto flag", "why": "Remove human bottleneck"}
  ],
  "outcome": {
    "result": "Pipeline generates documents end-to-end, demo successful",
    "success": true
  },
  "lesson": {
    "insight": "When human is bottleneck, make the agent the worker — give it tools + DoD",
    "applies_when": "Manual data entry is blocking a pipeline that otherwise works"
  }
}
```

When a new situation arises, `search_memory` finds relevant experiences by matching the **situation**, not keywords — so "document automation client" finds lessons from a Ukrainian waste management project because the *pattern* matches.

**Three levels of use:**
1. **Now:** Experience layer as system prompt — skill queries Qdrant, formats advice
2. **Soon:** Compress with [compresr.ai](https://compresr.ai) to fit all 269 labels in context
3. **Later:** LoRA fine-tune on labeled data (context→actions→outcome format)

## Why OpenExp?

| Feature | OpenExp | Mem0 | Zep/Graphiti | LangMem |
|---------|---------|------|-------------|---------|
| **Learns from outcomes** | Yes — Q-learning from real business results | No | No | No |
| **Process-aware** | Define pipeline stages with reward signals | No | No | No |
| **Memory type filtering** | Reward only decisions/insights, not noise | No | No | No |
| **Outcome-based rewards** | CRM deal closes → tagged memories get rewarded | No | No | No |
| **Claude Code native** | Zero-config hooks, works out of the box | Requires integration | Requires integration | Requires integration |
| **Local-first** | Qdrant + FastEmbed, no cloud, no API key for core | Cloud API | Cloud or self-hosted | Cloud API |
| **Hybrid retrieval** | BM25 + vector + recency + importance + Q-value (5 signals) | Vector only | Graph + vector | Vector only |
| **Privacy** | All data stays on your machine | Data sent to cloud | Depends on setup | Data sent to cloud |

**The key difference:** skills say how. Memory tools store. OpenExp **learns what works** — from real outcomes.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthroos/openexp.git
cd openexp
./setup.sh
```

That's it. Open Claude Code in any project — it now has memory.

> [!TIP]
> No API key needed for core functionality. Embeddings run locally via FastEmbed. An Anthropic API key is optional — it enables auto-enrichment (type classification, tags, validity windows) but everything works great without it.

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+, Docker, jq

## What You'll See

When you open Claude Code after a few sessions:

```
# OpenExp Memory (Q-value ranked)
Query: my-project | Monday 2026-03-22

## Relevant Context
[sim=0.82 q=0.73] Fixed auth bug by adding token refresh logic in api/auth.py
[sim=0.76 q=0.65] Project uses FastAPI + PostgreSQL, deployed on Railway
[sim=0.71 q=0.58] User prefers pytest with fixtures, not unittest
```

`q=0.73` means this memory consistently leads to productive sessions. `q=0.31` means it's been recalled but didn't help — it'll rank lower next time.

## How It Works

Three hooks integrate with Claude Code automatically:

| Hook | When | What |
|------|------|------|
| **SessionStart** | Session opens | Searches Qdrant for relevant memories, injects top results as context |
| **UserPromptSubmit** | Every message | Lightweight recall — adds relevant memories to each prompt |
| **PostToolUse** | After Write/Edit/Bash | Captures what Claude does as observations (JSONL) |
| **SessionEnd** | Session closes | Summary → ingest → reward → decision extraction (async) |

After each session, Opus 4.6 reads the conversation transcript and extracts **decisions** (not actions) — strategic choices, insights, and commitments that have value for future similar situations. See [Decision Extraction](docs/decision-extraction.md).

The MCP server provides 16 tools for memory operations, introspection, and calibration.

### Q-Learning Details

Every memory has a Q-value (starts at 0.0 — earn value from zero). Three layers capture different aspects:

| Layer | Weight | Measures |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **action** | 50% | Did recalling this help get work done? |
| **hypothesis** | 20% | Was the information accurate? |
| **fit** | 30% | Was it relevant to the context? |

Update rule:

```
Q_new = clamp(Q_old + α × reward, floor, ceiling)

α = 0.25 (learning rate)
reward ∈ [-1.0, 1.0] (productivity signal)
floor = -0.5, ceiling = 1.0
```

Retrieval scoring combines five signals:

```
score = 0.30 × vector_similarity    # semantic match
      + 0.10 × bm25_score           # keyword match
      + 0.15 × recency              # exponential decay (90-day half-life)
      + 0.15 × importance           # type-weighted metadata
      + 0.30 × q_value              # learned quality
```

With 10% epsilon-greedy exploration — occasionally surfaces low-Q memories to give them another chance.

## MCP Tools

Five focused tools (hippocampus model — write everything, retrieve selectively):

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_memory` | Hybrid search: BM25 + vector + recency + importance + Q-value reranking. Filter by type (e.g., `type="experience"` for experience labels) |
| `add_memory` | Store memory with auto-enrichment (type, tags, validity). Supports `client_id` for entity tagging |
| `log_prediction` | Track a prediction for later outcome resolution |
| `log_outcome` | Resolve prediction with reward → updates Q-values |
| `memory_stats` | Collection stats, point counts by source/type, session count |

## CLI

```bash
# Search memories
openexp search -q "authentication flow" -n 5

# Search only experience labels
openexp search -q "client demo" -n 5 -t experience

# Ingest transcripts into Qdrant
openexp ingest

# Experience Library pipeline
openexp chunk                    # chunk transcripts into ~200K token batches
openexp topics                   # extract topics per chunk via LLM
# Thread grouping + experience labeling via scripts/batch_label.py

# Show stats
openexp stats

# Memory compaction (merge similar memories)
openexp compact --dry-run

# Manage experience profiles
openexp experience list
openexp experience show sales

# Visualization
openexp viz --replay latest      # session replay
```

## Configuration

All settings via environment variables (`.env`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `QDRANT_HOST` | `localhost` | Qdrant server host |
| `QDRANT_PORT` | `6333` | Qdrant server port |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | *(none)* | Optional: Qdrant auth (also passed to Docker) |
| `OPENEXP_COLLECTION` | `openexp_memories` | Qdrant collection name |
| `OPENEXP_DATA_DIR` | `~/.openexp/data` | Q-cache, predictions, retrieval logs |
| `OPENEXP_OBSERVATIONS_DIR` | `~/.openexp/observations` | Where hooks write observations |
| `OPENEXP_SESSIONS_DIR` | `~/.openexp/sessions` | Session summary files |
| `OPENEXP_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` | Embedding model (local, free) |
| `OPENEXP_EMBEDDING_DIM` | `384` | Embedding dimensions |
| `OPENEXP_INGEST_BATCH_SIZE` | `50` | Batch size for ingestion |
| `OPENEXP_OUTCOME_RESOLVERS` | *(none)* | Outcome resolvers (format: `module:Class`) |
| `OPENEXP_CRM_DIR` | *(none)* | CRM directory for CRMCSVResolver |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | *(none)* | Optional: enables LLM-based enrichment |
| `OPENEXP_ENRICHMENT_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Model for auto-enrichment |

**Anthropic API key is optional.** Without it, memories get default metadata. With it, each memory is automatically classified (type, importance, tags, validity window).

### Memory Lifecycle

Memories move through 8 states to prevent stale context:

```
active ──→ confirmed ──→ outdated ──→ archived ──→ deleted
  │            │                          ↑
  ├──→ contradicted ──────────────────────┘
  ├──→ merged
  └──→ superseded
```

Only `active` and `confirmed` memories are returned in searches. Status weights affect scoring: `confirmed=1.2×`, `active=1.0×`, `outdated=0.5×`, `archived=0.3×`.

### Data Flow

```
PostToolUse hook                                  SessionStart hook
      │                                                 ↑
      ↓                                                 │
~/.openexp/observations/*.jsonl                Qdrant search (top 10)
      │                                          + Q-value reranking
      ↓                                                 ↑
SessionEnd hook ──→ summary .md                         │
      │                                                 │
      ↓ (async)                                         │
openexp ingest ──→ FastEmbed ──→ Qdrant ─────────────────┘
      │                            ↑
      ↓                            │
Q-Cache (q_cache.json) ←── reward signal ←── outcomes (CRM, predictions, retro)
```

## Technical Details

| Component | Choice | Why |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| **Embeddings** | FastEmbed (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5) | Local, free, no API key, 384 dimensions |
| **Vector DB** | Qdrant | Fast ANN search, payload filtering, Docker-ready |
| **Q-Cache** | In-memory LRU (100K entries) | Fast lookup, delta-based persistence for concurrent sessions |
| **Transport** | MCP STDIO (JSON-RPC 2.0) | Native Claude Code integration |
| **Hooks** | Bash scripts | Minimal dependencies, shell-level integration |

## Troubleshooting

**Docker / Qdrant won't start:**
```bash
# Check Docker is running
docker info

# Check Qdrant container
docker ps -a | grep openexp-qdrant
docker logs openexp-qdrant
```

**Hooks not firing:**
```bash
# Verify hooks are registered
cat ~/.claude/settings.local.json | jq '.hooks'

# Re-run setup to fix registration
./setup.sh
```

**No memories appearing:**
Memories need to be ingested first. After a few Claude Code sessions:
```bash
openexp ingest --dry-run   # preview what will be ingested
openexp ingest             # ingest into Qdrant
openexp stats              # check Q-cache state
```

## Experiences — Define Your Process

Not everyone writes code. An **Experience** defines what "productive" means for your workflow, including pipeline stages and which memory types matter.

| Experience | Process | Top Signals |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `default` | backlog → in_progress → review → merged → deployed | commits, PRs, tests |
| `sales` | lead → contacted → qualified → proposal → negotiation → won | decisions, emails, follow-ups |
| `dealflow` | lead → discovery → nda → proposal → negotiation → invoice → paid | proposals, invoices, payments |

Switch with one env var:
```bash
export OPENEXP_EXPERIENCE=dealflow
```

Each experience also controls **which memory types get rewarded** — sales rewards decisions and insights, not raw tool actions. This means the system learns faster because it focuses on the signal, not the noise.

**Create your own** with the interactive wizard:
```bash
openexp experience create
# Pick a process type (dev/sales/support/content)
# Customize stages, signal weights, memory type filters
```

See the [Experiences Guide](docs/experiences.md) for full details.

Key areas where help is welcome:

- **New experiences** — domain-specific reward profiles (DevOps, writing, research, etc.)
- **Outcome resolvers** — new integrations beyond CRM (Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues)
- **Multi-project learning** — sharing relevant context across projects
- **Benchmarks** — measuring retrieval quality improvement over time
- **Automated lifecycle transitions** — contradiction detection, staleness heuristics

## Research

OpenExp implements value-driven memory retrieval inspired by [MemRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09560), adapted for episodic memory in AI coding assistants.

Core insight: treating memory retrieval as a reinforcement learning problem — where the reward signal comes from real session outcomes — produces better context selection than similarity-only search.
